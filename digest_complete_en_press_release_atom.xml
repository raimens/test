	<p><span>Chief Executive Officer Robert Oudmayer commented: “Our business model has proved resilient in the current economic environment, and our conservative risk management approach is paying off. The lockdown in Switzerland had a clear impact on income from credit card fees. At the same time, we observed a sustainable shift towards cards payments and away from cash. Starting in May, credit card transaction volumes began to recover and were above last year’s levels already in month June. We are also pleased to have successfully completed the integration of cashgate in just 11 months and can now continue to focus on further developing the business.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Following the completion of the acquisition of cashgate on 2 September 2019, cashgate’s figures have been included in Cembra’s half-year results.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Resilient business performance</span></strong></p><p><span>The Group’s total net financing receivables at 30 June 2020 amounted to CHF 6.4 billion, a decline of 3% compared with 31 December 2019, largely attributable to the impact of covid-19 lockdown in Switzerland.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>In the personal loans business, receivables declined by 4% to CHF 2.5 billion in the first six months of 2020. Due to the acquisition in the second half of 2019, interest income in that business increased by 23% to CHF 97.2 million, with a yield of 7.4%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Net financing receivables in auto leases and loans declined by 3% to CHF 2.8 billion in the reporting period. Interest income was 32% higher, at CHF 65.3 million, with a yield of 4.5%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>In the credit cards business, net financing receivables declined by 4% to CHF 1.0 billion. Interest income in the cards business grew by 9% to CHF 41.6 million, with a yield of 8.2%. The number of cards issued continued to increase, up 7% year on year to 1,009,000, while transaction volumes declined by 7% year on year.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Revenue increase driven by acquisition</span></strong></p><p><span>Total net revenues rose by 12% to CHF 249.3 million. Interest income grew by 22% mainly as a result of the cashgate acquisition. Interest expense was 28% higher, at CHF 13.7 million. This reflects the CHF 1.4 billion increase in funding for the acquisition in the second half of 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Commission and fee income decreased by 11% to CHF 60.0 million as a result of the covid-19 lockdown. The decline was mainly driven by a decrease in income from credit card fees (–27% year on year), which were weighed down by lower spending during the lockdown. This caused the share of net revenues generated from commissions and fees to decrease to 24%, down from 30% at 30 June 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Total operating expenses increased by 21% to CHF 125.3 million. Personnel expenses came in at CHF 65.8 million, up 15% following the addition of 134 FTEs (+17%) after 30 June 2019 predominantly from cashgate. General and administrative expenses rose 28% to CHF 59.6 million mainly due to the acquisition and integration of cashgate. The cost/income ratio increased to 50.3%, compared to 46.5% in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for the integration costs for cashgate, the cost/income ratio stood at 47.9%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Stable loss performance</span></strong></p><p><span>The provision for losses increased by CHF 11.0 million or 57% to CHF 30.2 million, primarily due to the higher base of financing receivables following the acquisition. Despite the unfavourable environment, this resulted in a loss rate of 0.9% (H1 2019: 0.8%) and the non-performing-loans (NPL) ratio came to 0.7%. The rate of over-30-days past due financing receivables remained stable at 2.1% (H1 2019: 2.0%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Integration of cashgate successfully completed</span></strong></p><p><span>In the reporting period, Cembra continued as planned with the operational integration of cashgate and completed it in July 2020. The legal merger is planned for 2021. Adapting to the accelerated digital transformation, Cembra further consolidated the branch network and will be operating a network of 13 branches across Switzerland going forward.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The invoice financing provider Swissbilling continued to grow, more than doubling its net financing receivables since year-end 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Stable funding</span></strong></p><p><span>In the first six months of 2020, the Group’s funding portfolio declined by 3% to CHF 6.0 billion, in line with the lower asset base. The funding mix remained stable compared to 31 December 2019. The weighted average duration was 2.8 years (31 December 2019: 2.9 years), and the period-end funding cost was 43 basis points (31 December 2019: 44 basis points).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Solid capital position</span></strong></p><p><span>Cembra remains very well capitalised, with a solid Tier 1 capital ratio of 17.0% (31 December 2019: 16.3%). Shareholders’ equity decreased by 3% to CHF 1.055 billion after Cembra had paid out the full dividend in April 2020, amounting to CHF&#160;110 million, for the financial year 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>ESG recognition further improved</span></strong></p><p><span>In the reporting period a number of leading ESG rating agencies upgraded Cembra’s sustainability ratings based on Cembra’s strong corporate governance and its low ESG risk profile. In April 2020, MSCI ESG<sup>®</sup> upgraded Cembra to A from BBB. In May 2020, Sustainalytics<sup>®</sup> upgraded Cembra to “Low ESG Risk”, and among all of the 112 consumer finance companies rated worldwide, Cembra ranked first.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Outlook</span></strong></p><p><span>In 2020, Cembra currently expects to deliver a resilient business performance, with revenues being impacted mainly by lower volumes in credit cards. Cembra expects a solid loss performance for the full year 2020. The costs of integrating cashgate should increasingly be offset by synergies of the acquisition as planned. Assuming an economic recovery in Switzerland in 2021, Cembra confirms its mid-term targets<sup>1</sup>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>All documents (investor presentation, interim report and this media release) are available at</span> <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/investors">www.cembra.ch/investors</a><span>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span><sup><span>1</span></sup> <span>Mid-term targets ROE &#x3E;

<p>Q1 2020 update: Cembra reports overall strong business performance</p>					</div>

				</div>
				<div class="lead">
	<p>Zurich – Due to Covid-19, Cembra is providing this update outside of the regular reporting cycle.</p>				</div>



				<div class="body">
	<p>In the first quarter 2020, Cembra delivered a strong business performance with net revenues increasing by 19% year-on-year (organic growth +1%) to CHF 128.2 million. Net interest income grew by 24% due to the successful commercial integration of cashgate. Commission and fee income increased by 6%, with credit card fees and commissions declining by 3%. In the month of March 2020, the credit card transaction volumes declined by 17% year-on-year due to lower spending abroad following the Covid-19 lockdown in Switzerland.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Net financing receivables amounted to CHF 6,449 million at the end of March 2020, down 2% compared to year-end 2019. Lower assets in credit cards were largely offset by a stable trend in personal loans and auto financing.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The loss rate in the first quarter 2020 improved year-on-year and was better than the corresponding budget. In the month of March, the 30+ days delinquencies and losses were in-line with the budgeted amounts. Operating expenses remained below the budgets due to benefits of the integration of cashgate, which is progressing as planned. As a result, net income for the first quarter 2020 came in above the management’s budget.&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The Group currently expects to deliver a resilient business performance in 2020, with revenues being impacted mainly by overall lower volumes in credit cards. Cembra confirms its mid-term targets<sup>1</sup> but suspends detailed guidance for 2020 due to the uncertainties related to the impact of Covid-19 on the Swiss economy and related governmental measures. Cembra will publish its half-year results on 23 July 2020.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><span><sup>1</sup> Mid-term targets ROE &#x3E; 15%, Tier 1 capital ratio 17% and dividend pay-out ratio 60-70%; assuming a recovery of the Swiss economy in 2021</span></p>				</div>

				<div class="body">
	<p><span>The introduction of Apple Pay marks a further addition to Cembra’s range of mobile payment solutions and caters to the growing demand for innovative digital payment solutions. Apple Pay works with all payment cards issued by Cembra. These cards include the Cumulus-Mastercard®, which is the most common credit card in Switzerland issued in partnership with Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund, the TCS Member Mastercard® issued with TCS, as well as TCS Travel Mastercard® Gold, the Cosy Mastercard® Conforama, the Fnac Mastercard® and the Cembra Mastercard® Premium and Gold.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Security and privacy are at the core of Apple Pay. When you use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, said: “We are pleased to be able to add Apple Pay to our range of mobile payment solutions, taking one more step in our digitisation strategy towards meeting more of our customers’ needs. As of now, all holders of credit cards issued by Cembra can use these to pay using Apple Pay anywhere in the world in shops, apps and on the web.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Apple Pay is easy to set up and users continue to benefit from all the advantages offered by Cembra Money Bank AG’s credit cards.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>With iPhone and Apple Watch, customers can pay with Apple Pay in stores, restaurants, taxis, vending machines and many more places. When shopping in apps or on the web in Safari with Apple Pay, there is no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information. Every Apple Pay purchase is authenticated with just a glance or a touch with Face ID or Touch ID, or a device's passcode.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>For more information on Apple Pay, visit:</span> <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse; border:medium none; width:100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="width:99.25pt; border:none; border-top:solid #004E7B 1.0pt;" valign="top" width="132"><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Contacts</span></strong></p></td><td style="width:359.75pt; border:none; border-top:solid #004E7B 1.0pt;" valign="top" width="480"><p>&#160;</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:99.25pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="132"><p><span>Media:</span></p></td><td style="width:359.75pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="480"><p><span>Carolin Schulze; +41 79 906 00 48;</span> <a href="mailto:media@cembra.ch">media@cembra.ch</a></p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:99.25pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="132"><p><span>Investor Relations:</span></p></td><td style="width:359.75pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="480"><p><span>Marcus Händel; +41 44 439 85 72;</span> <a href="mailto:investor.relations@cembra.ch">investor.relations@cembra.ch</a></p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:99.25pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="132">&#160;</td><td style="width:359.75pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="480">&#160;</td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse; border:medium none; width:100%;"><tbody><tr><td style="width:465.15pt; border:none; border-top:solid #004E7B 1.0pt;" valign="top" width="620"><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>About Cembra Money Bank</span></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:465.15pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="620"><p>&#160;</p></td></tr><tr><td style="width:465.15pt; border:none;" valign="top" width="620"><p><span>Cembra is a leading Swiss provider of financing solutions and services.

	<p><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “2019 was another very successful year for Cembra. We are very pleased that we gained more than 130’000 new customers in 2019 and that we now serve over one million customers in Switzerland. We are looking forward to further digitising our businesses, developing our new partnerships in the cards business, and rolling out our new online financing product for small companies.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Following the completion of the acquisition of cashgate on 2 September 2019, cashgate’s figures have been included in Cembra’s full-year results for the last four months of the year.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Profitable growth across all business lines</span></strong></p><p><span>The Group’s net financing receivables rose by 37% to a record CHF 6.6 billion as a result of the consolidation of cashgate. Despite strong competition in all businesses, Cembra’s organic asset growth, excluding cashgate, stood at 6%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>In the personal loans business, receivables increased by 39% to CHF 2.6 billion (+2% excluding cashgate). Interest income in the personal loans business increased by 7% to CHF 172.6 million with a yield of 7.5%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Net financing receivables in auto leases and loans grew by 48% to CHF 2.9 billion in the reporting period (+7% excluding cashgate). Interest income was 12% higher, at CHF 110.6 million, with a yield of 4.5% for the auto financing business.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The solid performance in the credit cards business was driven by the higher number of cards issued (up 10% year on year to 984,000) and the further increase in transaction volumes (up 10% year on year). Net financing receivables grew 9% to CHF 1.0 billion. Interest income in the cards business grew by 11% to CHF 79.4 million, with an 8.0% yield.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Steady revenue increase</span></strong></p><p><span>Net revenues rose by 9% to CHF 479.7 million (+4% excluding cashgate). Interest income grew by 9% as a result of the acquisition and higher credit card volumes. Interest expense was 34% higher at CHF 27.8 million, reflecting the CHF 1.8 billion increase in funding.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Commission and fee income increased by 14% to CHF 147.7 million, influenced by the acquisition and thanks to strong credit card fee income, as well as other income mainly relating to the invoice finance provider Swissbilling. The share of net revenues generated from commissions and fees increased to 31%, compared with 30% in 2018.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Total operating expenses increased by 20% to CHF 231.8 million. Personnel expenses came in at CHF 120.5 million, up 14% following the addition of 180 FTEs (+23%) in 2019, including 134 employees from cashgate. General and administrative expenses rose 28% to CHF 111.3 million, mainly as a result of the integration of cashgate, together with continued investments in technology and growth initiatives. The cost/income ratio increased to 48.3%. Excluding the acquisition – the cost of integrating cashgate amounted to around CHF 8 million in 2019 – the cost/income ratio was 45.5% (2018: 44.0%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Favourable loss performance</span></strong></p><p><span>The provision for losses decreased by CHF 5.0 million, or 10%, to CHF 45.1 million, despite the expanding loan portfolio. This decline was due to the continued favourable macro environment and a one-off effect due to better synchronisation of write-off and collection procedures. This resulted in a loss rate of 0.8% (2018: 1.1%) and a higher non-performing-loans (NPL) ratio of 0.6% (2018: 0.4%) resulting from the synchronisation process. The rate of over-30-days past due financing receivables remained stable at 1.8% (2018: 1.8%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Timely integration of cashgate well on track</span></strong></p><p><span>Since the completion of the acquisition on 2 September 2019, Cembra is executing on the integration as planned. In December 2019, all employees at cashgate’s headquarters moved to their new offices at Cembra headquarters in Zurich-Altstetten. Since 1 January 2020, Cembra’s auto business has been operating on a single system, and the cashgate brand will be maintained for online offering for personal loans. By April 2020, Cembra Money Bank expects to have consolidated all cashgate branches and will then be operating a network of 17 branches across Switzerland. Robert Oudmayer said: “We are very pleased to see the new teams working together successfully, and the progress being made. The integration is well on track and our business is in good shape to continue to deliver profitable growth.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Progress in new businesses</span></strong></p><p><span>In Q4 2019, the Group expanded its product portfolio as planned, with an online financing product for small companies in Switzerland under the new Cembra Business brand. The commercial roll-out of the new product started on 17 February 2020. Swissbilling more than doubled its revenues in 2019 compared to 2018.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Bridge loan facility fully paid back</span></strong></p><p><span>Since the announcement of the acquisition of cashgate on 1 July, Cembra Money Bank has fully paid off the transaction through various capital market instruments and deposits. The bridge loan facility amounting to CHF&#160;1.5 billion was paid back in full by November 2019, with Cembra’s funding portfolio rising by 42% to CHF 6.1 billion at year-end. The weighted average remaining maturity was 2.9 years and the period-end funding cost declined from 49 to 44 basis points.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Solid capital position and stable dividend</span></strong></p><p><span>Cembra remains very well capitalised, with a solid Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.3%, which is within the 16–17% range indicated for 2019. The leverage ratio amounted to 12.5%. Shareholders’ equity increased by 17% to CHF 1.091 billion, predominantly relating to the sale of treasury shares in July 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Given Cembra’s solid financial performance, the Board of Directors will recommend a dividend of CHF 3.75 per share (representing a payout ratio of 68%) at the next Annual General Meeting on 16 April 2020. Given that organic growth was stronger than expected in the second half of the year, and in order to maintain flexibility for further growth, Cembra does not propose that the remaining treasury shares be cancelled at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Thomas Buess proposed for election to the Board of Directors</span></strong></p><p><span>The Board of Directors of Cembra will propose to the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting on 16 April 2020 the election of Thomas Buess as a new member to the Board of Directors. He will replace Ben Tellings, who stepped down as of 31 December 2019.&#160;</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Thomas Buess, Swiss citizen, has spent over thirty years of his career in the financial services and insurance sector in several roles for companies such as Elvia, Zurich Insurance Group and Allianz Group. From 2009 until 2019 he served as Group Chief Financial Officer at Swiss Life Group. Since 2019, he is member of the Board of Directors of Swiss Life Group.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Outlook</span></strong></p><p><span>In 2020, Cembra expects to continue to deliver profitable growth across all business lines. The costs of integrating cashgate should be partly offset by synergies from the acquisition. The loss performance in 2020 is expected to be in line with prior years. Assuming no major change in the economic environment, Cembra expects earnings per share for the 2020 financial year to increase to between CHF 5.75 and CHF 6.05. From 2021 on, Cembra continues to expect growth in profits to pick up pace, with net annual incremental net income from the acquisition by CHF 25–30 million.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>All documents (investor presentation and this media release) are available at</span> <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/investors">www.cembra.ch/investors</a>.</p>				</div>

	<p><span>Zurich – Net income of Cembra Money Bank in the first half of 2019 increased by 1% to CHF 78.6 million or CHF 2.79 per share. The good momentum in auto financing and the continued growth in credit cards contributed to a 5% growth in net revenues. This translated into a 17.1% return on equity coupled with a strong Tier 1 capital ratio of 18.8%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Cembra attracted more than 40,000 new customers in the last six months. This lead to a strong half-year result with profitable growth in all business lines. Now we look forward to launching our online financing product for small companies as well as to our expansion and digitisation together with cashgate“.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Profitable growth across all products</span></strong></p><p><span>The Group’s net financing receivables rose by 4% to a record CHF 5,023 million, driven by organic growth across all products and a timing effect at the end of the reporting period (net financial receivables grew 2.1% by end of May 2019). In the personal loan business, receivables increased by 1% to CHF 1,913 million. Interest income in personal loans was stable at CHF 79.1 million, despite of the lower yield of the personal loan business which amounted to 8.2%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Net financing receivables in auto leases and loans grew by 4% to CHF 2,062 million in the reporting period. Interest income was 1% higher at CHF 49.5 million with a yield of 4.9% for the auto financing business.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The performance of the credit card business was driven by a higher number of cards issued (up 11% year-on-year to 946,000) and a continued increase in volume (up 9% year-on-year). Net financing receivables recorded a 10% growth reaching CHF 1,036 million. Interest income in the cards business grew by 11% to CHF 38.3 million with a 7.7% yield.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Steady revenue increase</span></strong></p><p><span>Net revenues rose by 5% to CHF 222.6 million. Net interest income grew by 2%, largely driven by higher credit card volumes. Interest expense was 6% higher at CHF 10.7 million, in line with the year-on-year receivables growth.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Commissions and fee income increased by 11% to CHF 67.6 million, mainly due to strong credit card fee income. 30% of net revenues were generated from commissions and fees compared to 29% in H1 2018.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Total operating expenses increased by 14% to CHF 103.6 million. Personnel expenses of CHF 56.9 million rose by 8% driven by 71 additional FTE (+10%) since June 2018. General and administrative expenses of CHF 46.7 million were 24% higher, mainly due to continued investments in technology and growth initiatives as well as pre-transaction costs relating to the acquisition of cashgate. These effects translated into a cost/income ratio of 46.5% (H1 2018: 42.6%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Solid loss performance</span></strong></p><p><span>Provision for losses of CHF 19.2 million was 20% lower, affected by the continued favourable macro environment and a one-off effect due to better synchronisation of write-off and collection procedures. This translated in a loss rate of 0.8% (FY 2018: 1.1%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Balanced funding of cashgate acquisition</span></strong></p><p><span>In the first six months of 2019, the Group further grew its funding portfolio to CHF 4,499 million with a stable funding mix. The average duration remained at 2.7 years and the period-end funding cost was 48 basis points (31. December 2018: 49 basis points).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Since the announcement of the acquisition of cashgate on 1 July 2019, Cembra successfully placed a balanced mix of deposits, senior debt, hybrid and equity instruments amounting to more than CHF 1.0 billion. With these transactions, about 70% of a committed bridge financing has been replaced.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank remains very well capitalised with a strong Tier 1 capital ratio of 18.8% and a leverage ratio of 14.6% as per 30 June 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Online financing for small enterprises</span></strong></p><p><span>The Group plans to expand its product portfolio with an online financing product for small companies in Switzerland. Cembra has entered a co-operation with Berlin-based Spotcap Global Services GmbH to provide the technology platform for the planned offering. The launch is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Outlook for 2019</span></strong></p><p><span>For the existing business, Cembra confirms the earnings per share (EPS) range previously indicated for 2019. Including the acquisition of cashgate announced on 1 July 2019, Cembra expects a FY 2019 EPS (diluted, US GAAP) of CHF 5.20–5.50. For 2019, Cembra aims to pay a dividend at least at the level of the previous year (CHF 3.75 per share).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The H1 2019 investor presentation is available at <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/investors">www.cembra.ch/investors</a></span><span>.</span></p>				</div>

				<div class="body">
	<p><span>Zurich – Cembra Money Bank AG has signed an agreement with Aduno Holding AG for the acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of cashgate AG, for a purchase price of CHF 277 million. The Bank continues executing on its growth strategy, following its acquisition of Swissbilling SA and EFL Autoleasing AG (both in 2017). With the acquisition of cashgate AG, Cembra Money Bank increases its financing portfolio in personal loans and auto leases &#x26; loans by around CHF 1.4 billion to a total of around CHF 6.2 billion. The transaction will lead to increased economies of scale and accelerate the digital transformation roadmap. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer of Cembra Money Bank, says, “With the acquisition of cashgate we continue to implement our growth strategy. Thanks to this acquisition we are further expanding our market position in the Swiss consumer finance space and growing as an independent provider of auto leases and loans. We also look forward to continue digitising our core business together with the experienced team at cashgate.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Pascal Niquille, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Aduno Group, says, “The Aduno Group and Cembra Money Bank focus on the Swiss market. Both companies are correspondingly familiar with Swiss circumstances and uphold the cultural values of our country. The agreement that has now been signed enables the Aduno Group to continue its focused strategy in a systematic manner. At the same time with Cembra Money Bank we have the guarantee that the employees leaving us will be working for a company with a similar culture and great respect for its workforce. For me this is a clear expression of a win-win situation, as all the parties will benefit from this agreement”.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Consolidation of market position</span></strong></p><p><span>cashgate AG, part of the Aduno Group, is an established Swiss provider of consumer loans and auto financing. Through this acquisition, Cembra strengthens its position in these markets and aims to expand its offering. The existing “cashgate” brand will continue in the online segment. In addition, cashgate AG also contributes innovations, distribution advantages and technical skills. Cembra intends to accelerate its digital transformation by leveraging cashgate’s IT platform.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>From the transaction Cembra expects total integration costs of around CHF 25 million until 2020. It is planned that the integration of cashgate AG into Cembra will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Balanced financing of the transaction</span></strong></p><p><span>The Bank is planning to finance the majority of the purchase price, depending on market conditions, with the placement of an Additional Tier 1 bond (AT1), as well as placing a portion of its treasury shares on the capital market, and using existing available cash. It is also currently foreseen to propose the cancellation of the unused treasury shares to the coming Annual General Meeting.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>In the context of the transaction agreement with Aduno, Cembra will refinance the balance sheet liabilities of cashgate AG amounting to around CHF 1.4 billion as of closing of the transaction.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The overall financing is backed by a committed bridge facility and a term loan from a banking consortium led by Deutsche Bank. In addition to the AT1 bond and the placing of the treasury shares, the remaining bridge facility will be repaid stepwise by means of a balanced mix of increased deposits, as well as senior bonds and ABS and the issuance of a convertible bond with net share and cash settlement features.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The balanced and diversified financing enables Cembra to keep its financial flexibility for continued profitable growth. The investments in digitisation and product development announced earlier this year as well as the growing cards business will not be impacted by the transaction.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Solid capital base with new Tier 1 target of 17%</span></strong></p><p><span>The Bank’s capital base remains solid. In connection with the effects of the transaction on its business and risk profile, Cembra is revising the medium-term target for the Tier 1 capital ratio to 17% (previously 18%). Accordingly the threshold for rule-based dividend payouts will also be lowered by one percentage point to 19%. Cembra expects that Standard &#x26; Poor’s will maintain its A</span><strong><span>–</span></strong> <span>rating for Cembra Money Bank AG.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Dividend aimed to be at least as high as the previous year</span></strong></p><p><span>The proven dividend policy of 60</span><strong><span>–</span></strong><span>70% of net profit will be continued. For the financial year 2019, Cembra aims to pay a dividend at least at the level of the previous year (CHF 3.75 per share), corresponding to a pay-out ratio of around 70%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Positive business performance in 2019</span></strong></p><p><span>In connection with the measures announced for financing the acquisition of cashgate AG, today Cembra is also disclosing an update to the most important key financial indicators in the first half of 2019. After the first five months, net receivables rose by 2.1%. Cembra expects net revenues&#160;to increase by 4% in the first half of 2019, compared to the same period in the previous year. Higher costs resulting from digitisation, among other factors, will be compensated by a significantly lower loss rate. As a result, Cembra expects a net profit for the first half-year between CHF 77 million and CHF 79 million, following CHF 77.7 million in the same period of the previous year. The Bank will publish the full interim report 2019 for the first half-year on 23 July, as planned.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Outlook 2019 for existing business confirmed</span></strong></p><p><span>For the existing business the earnings per share (EPS) range previously indicated for 2019 is confirmed. Including the acquisition, Cembra expects a FY 2019 post-transaction EPS (diluted, US GAAP) of CHF 5.20</span><strong><span>–</span></strong><span>5.50 and a positive impact on EPS from as early as 2020 onwards.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>From 2021 onwards, the transaction is expected to generate an incremental net profit of CHF 25</span><strong><span>–</span></strong><span>30 million per annum. In the mid-term Cembra expects a stable loss ratio, and a cost income-ratio below 44%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>A presentation for investors can be accessed via the following link: <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/investors">www.cembra.ch/investors</a></span></p>				</div>

	<p align="justify"><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “We are very pleased with our 2018 financial result, as this is the best full-year result in the history of our company. We again delivered on our targets, with profitable growth in all business lines. In 2019 we will continue to focus on digitisation of our core business as well as push innovation to improve our interaction with customers.“</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span><strong>Growth across all products</strong></span></p><p align="justify"><span>The Bank’s net financing receivables increased by 5% to a record CHF 4,807 million with organic growth across all products. In the personal loan business receivables increased by 6% to CHF 1,885 million while interest income declined by 3% to CHF 161.3 million, mainly due to the lower yield of the personal loan business which amounted to 8.6% (2017: 9.3%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span>Net financing receivables in the auto leases and loans business increased by 2% to CHF 1,974 million. Interest income increased by 17% to 98.4 CHF million mainly driven by the acquisition of EFL Autoleasing. The yield of the auto financing business increased slightly to 5.0% (FY 2017: 4.9%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span>In the credit cards business net financing receivables recorded 13% growth reaching CHF 940 million by year-end 2018. Interest income in the cards business grew by 19% to CHF 71.7 million with an 8.0% yield. The number of credit cards issued by Cembra Money Bank amounted to 892,000. This corresponds to a growth of about 89,000 credit cards issued (+11%) compared to the previous year.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span><strong>Net revenues +11%</strong></span></p><p align="justify"><span>Net revenues increased by 11% to CHF 438.8 million with organic growth of 7%. Net interest income, which accounted for 70% of net revenues, increased by 9% to CHF 309.2 million. Interest income grew 7% (organic growth 2%) largely driven by higher credit card volumes and expansion in the loan business. Cembra continued to benefit from the favourable interest rate environment with a decline of 16% in interest expense.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span>Commissions and fee income contributed to 30% of net revenues compared to 28% in 2017. The 15% growth to CHF 129.6 million was mainly driven by strong credit card fee income.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span><strong>Asset quality stable</strong></span></p><p align="justify"><span>Provision for losses of CHF 50.1 million were 11% higher as a result of growth of the loan portfolio, and the full-year impact of acquisitions. Asset quality remained robust with a loss rate of 1.1% (2017: 1.0%) and a stable non-performing loans (NPL) ratio of 0.4% (2017: 0.4%).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span><strong>Investing in digitisation and extending product portfolio</strong></span></p><p align="justify"><span>Total operating expenses increased by 15% to CHF 193.0 million. Personnel expenses of CHF 105.8 million increased by 6% driven by 48 additional FTEs. General and administrative expenses of CHF 87.2 million were 28% higher mainly due to investments in technology and growth initiatives in the second half of 2018. This lead to a cost/income ratio of 44.0% (adjusted cost/income ratio of 43.1% before reclassification for new revenue recognition US GAAP standards implemented in 2018).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span>Cembra continues to invest in new origination and servicing platforms and launches further growth initiatives in order to extend the products into new customer segments and distribution channels. This also includes new propositions from Swissbilling which was acquired in 2017. The Bank expects total additional costs of about CHF 40 million for the next 3-4 years.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span><strong>Continued optimisation of funding</strong></span></p><p align="justify"><span>The Group further grew its funding portfolio to CHF 4,329 million with a stable funding mix of 65% deposits and 35% non-deposits. The weighted average remaining maturity was 2.7 years and the period-end funding cost declined from 52 to 49 basis points.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span>Shareholders’ equity increased by 5% to CHF 933 million. Cembra Money Bank remains very well capitalised with a strong Tier 1 capital ratio of 19.2% and a leverage ratio of 14.7%. Excess capital above the Bank’s minimum Tier 1 target of 18% amounts to CHF 52 million.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span><strong>Increasing the dividend</strong></span></p><p align="justify"><span>In-line with the financial performance, the Board of Directors will propose a CHF 3.75 ordinary dividend per share (a 69% pay-out ratio) at the next Annual General Meeting on 17 April 2019 translating into a 6%, or CHF 0.20, increase.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span><strong>Outlook for 2019</strong></span></p><p align="justify"><span>Assuming no major change in the economic environment, the Group is expecting increased earnings per share between CHF 5.40 and CHF 5.70 for the financial year of 2019. Continued growth in credit cards should offset the decline in interest income from personals loans. The continued cost discipline is expected to benefit from efficiency gains which will be offset by further investments in digitisation and product development.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><span>All documents (investor presentation and this media release) are available at</span> <u><a href="http://www.cembra.ch/investors"><span>www.cembra.ch/investors</span></a></u><span>.</span></p><p align="justify"><span>______________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>				</div>

	<p><span>Zurich – Cembra Money Bank’s (Ticker: CMBN) excellent results in the first half-year 2018 were driven by the strong performance of the core businesses coupled with recent growth initiatives. Improvements across all business lines resulted in an asset growth of 4 %, translating into net financing receivables of CHF 4.7 billion.</span><br />&#160;</p><p><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “We are very pleased with our results, as this is the best first half-year result in the history of our company. We achieved growth in all our business lines, while maintaining our prudent risk management strategy and cost efficiency. Cembra remains strongly capitalised, and we aim to continue to invest excess capital in additional future growth. Consequently, we are raising our full-year 2018 earnings-per-share guidance.“<br /><br /><strong><span>Steady revenue increase</span></strong></span></p><p><span>Net revenues increased by 11 % (organic growth 6 %) to CHF 213.0 million. Net interest income, which accounted for approximately 71 % of net revenues, increased by 10 % to CHF 152.1 million, translating into a net interest margin of 6.5 %. The higher interest income was mainly driven by the acquisition of EFL Autoleasing AG in October 2017 and the continued performance of the credit card business. In addition, the Bank had lower interest expenses due to favourable repricing in a continued low interest rate environment. Income from credit cards increased by 25 % to CHF 43.2 million, driven by the increase in the number of cards and higher transaction volume. Consequently, commission and fee income amounted to CHF 60.9 million (an increase of 13 %). Insurance income (CHF 9.8 million) was 18 % lower following the termination of a partnership agreement. Provision for losses on financing receivables were CHF 23.9 million, translating into a loss rate of 1.0 % in line with prior periods, thus reflecting Cembra’s continued risk management discipline.<br /><br /><span>Total operating expenses increased by 9 % to CHF 90.6 million. Compensation and benefits expenses were up 7 % to CHF 52.8 million as a result of higher headcount due to the acquisition of EFL Autoleasing AG and additional employees at Swissbilling. The cost/income ratio slightly decreased to 42.6 % as a result of higher revenues offset by increased operating expenses. Income before taxes increased by 12 % to CHF 98.5 million, translating into a net income of CHF 77.7 million after tax or CHF 2.76 per share.</span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Sustainable growth across all products</span></strong></p><p><span>Net financing receivables increased by 4 % to CHF 4.7 billion in the first half-year 2018: personal loans business was up 4 % (CHF 1.9 billion), auto leases and loans were up 2 % (CHF 2.0 billion) and credit card business was up 8 % (CHF 0.9 billion).<br /><br /><span>The performance of the credit card business was driven by the increase in transaction volume (up 19 %) and by a higher number of circa 850,000 cards (up 11 %) compared to the first half-year 2017, generating a 7.9 % yield. The auto business maintained a 5.0 % yield; cooperations with Hyundai, Honda, Ssang Yong and Harley Davidson performed well in the first half of the year. The company continued to defend its market share in the personal loans segment despite strong competition, with assets growing at 4 % with a 8.6 % yield.</span><br /><br /><strong><span>Ongoing optimisation of funding</span></strong><br /><span>The Bank further optimised its funding portfolio on the back of the ongoing and persistent low interest rate environment. The end-of-period funding costs of Cembra were down from 52 basis points to 49 basis points. Overall, the funding mix with 64 % deposits and 36 % non-deposits and the average remaining maturity at 2.8 years remained stable.</span><br /><br /><span>Shareholders’ equity decreased by 2 % to CHF 864 million as a result of the dividend payment of CHF 100.1 million in May, partially offset by the half-year 2018 net income of CHF 77.7 million, translating into a Tier 1 capital ratio of 18.9 % and a leverage ratio of 14.5 %.</span><br /><br /><strong><span>Enhanced positioning for small business loans and strengthened Management Board</span></strong><br /><span>In March, Cembra signed an agreement with Lendico Schweiz AG, a 100 % subsidiary of PostFinance AG, to finance small business loans sourced via the Lendico online platform. In addition to financing, Cembra will provide collection services for the portfolio financed by Cembra.</span><br /><br /><span>In April, the company announced that Niklaus Mannhart has been appointed Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Cembra Money Bank; he will assume the newly created position as of 1 August 2018 and become a member of the Bank’s Management Board. In June, Cembra appointed Jörg Fohringer as B2B Leader. He will take over this function on 1 December 2018 and also become a member of the Bank’s Management Board.</span><br /><br /><strong><span>Increased guidance for full-year 2018</span></strong><br /><span>Assuming no major change in the current economic environment and in business performance, the Group raises the full-year EPS guidance to between CHF 5.20 and CHF 5.50 from between CHF 4.80 and CHF 5.10. Additional revenues from the recent acquisitions and the ongoing growth of the credit card business are expected to more than offset the impact of the rate cap on interest income in the personal loans business. Operating expenses are expected to slightly increase, driven by higher headcount and further investments in the digitalisation of the business and growth initiatives, translating into a stable cost/income ratio. Loss performance is expected to be in line with prior years.</span><br /><br /><strong><span>Media conference today at 10:30 a.m.</span></strong><br /><span>Cembra Money Bank will host a media event today at 10:30 a.m. at the Renaissance Zurich Tower Hotel in Zurich, Turbinenstrasse 20.</span><br /><br /><span>All documents (half-year report 2018, shareholder letter, investor presentation and this media release) are available at <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/en/investor">www.cembra.ch/en/investor</a>.</span></span></p>				</div>

	<p align="justify">Zurich – Net income of Cembra Money Bank (Ticker: CMBN) in 2017 was CHF 144.5 million resulting in earnings per share of CHF 5.13. This translated into a 16.7 % return on shareholders’ equity coupled with a solid CET 1 capital ratio of 19.2 %. Net financing receivables increased by 12 % to CHF 4.6 billion driven by both acquisitions (8 %) and organic growth (4 %). An ordinary dividend per share of CHF 3.55 will be presented to the Annual General Meeting on 18 April 2018 in Zurich.</p>				</div>



				<div class="body">
	<p align="justify">Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “We are very satisfied with our 2017 financial result, delivering on all our targets. We recorded growth across all our products. We successfully managed to offset the pressure from the interest rate reduction and the lower domestic interchange fee. With the recent acquisitions and new partnerships we act in line with the Group’s strategy and we are well positioned for the future.“</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Strong fee and commission income in cards offsetting lower interest income</strong></p><p align="justify">Overall, net revenues increased by 1 % to CHF 396.3 million. Net interest income, which accounted for 72 % of net revenues, declined 5 % to CHF 283.6 million following the implementation of the interest rate cap in July 2016. Interest expense reduced by 7 % as the Group continued to take advantage of the continued low-negative interest environment to refinance upcoming maturities and acquisitions. Commission and fee income, which contributed 28 % of net revenues, grew 17 % to CHF 112.7 million, mainly driven by strong credit cards fee income (up 18 %). Provision for losses on financing receivables were CHF 45.1 million translating into a loss rate of 1.0 % which was in-line with the performance in prior years. Asset quality remained robust with a 0.4% non-performing loan ratio which was in-line with last year.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Total operating expenses were CHF 167.9 million. Personnel expenses of CHF 99.9 million marginally reduced as a result of lower pension costs, despite an increase in headcount following the two acquisitions. General and administrative expenses of CHF 68.0 million were 1 % higher mainly due to the on-going investment in the digitalisation of the business and increasing regulatory requirements. The cost/income ratio of 42.4 % was in-line with last year. Income before taxes increased by 1 % to CHF 183.3 million resulting in net income of CHF 144.5 million after tax or CHF 5.13 per share.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Financing receivables growth across all products</strong></p><p align="justify">The Group’s net financing receivables increased by 12 %, or CHF 489 million, to a record CHF 4,562 million with growth across all products. Acquisitions accounted for CHF 327 million (or 8 %) and organic growth accounted for CHF 162 million (or 4 %).</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Net financing receivables in the personal loan business increased by 4 % to CHF 1,782 million. Interest income of CHF 167.1 million was 13 % lower due to the implementation of the rate cap translating into a 9.3 % yield. By the end of 2017 the vast majority of the personal loans portfolio had been re-priced.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">The Swiss auto market was stable in 2017 with a flat used car market and a 1 % reduction in new car registration. The Group’s net financing receivables of the auto leases and loans business increased by 18 % (or 1 % excluding the EFL acquisition) to CHF 1,942 million. The acquisition of EFL Autoleasing (the deal was closed on 30 November 2017 with only one month impact) added CHF 278 million of net financing receivables. Overall, interest income increased marginally to CHF 83.8 million generating a 4.9 % yield.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Net financing receivables in the credit cards business recorded a strong growth of 17 % reaching CHF 833 million at year-end 2017. The increase was driven by the increase in the number of cards issued, by higher average customer spending and by the increase in the number of transactions per card. Consequently interest income grew by 17 % to CHF 60.5 million with a 7.8 % yield. The number of credit cards issued increased by 10 %, or 76,000, to circa 803,000.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Balance sheet reached the CHF 5 billion mark</strong></p><p align="justify">The Group reached a new milestone with CHF 5,099 million in total assets, breaking the CHF 5 billion mark for the first time since the IPO. The funding portfolio increased to CHF 4,048 million (from CHF 3,874 million) and the funding mix shifted to 65 % deposits and 35 % non-deposits to finance both acquisitions and organic growth. The Bank raised a total of CHF 350 million via the issuance of two senior unsecured bonds of CHF 150 million and CHF 200 million in June and November 2017 respectively. Overall, the average remaining maturity increased from 2.7 years to 2.9 years and the average remaining funding cost was reduced from 66 basis points to 52 basis points.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Shareholders’ equity increased by 4 % to CHF 885 million with the payment of 2016 dividend of CHF 125.5 million in May 2017 which was more than compensated by the net income. CET 1 capital ratio was 19.2 % with a 15.4 % leverage ratio and the excess capital above the Group’s minimum CET 1 target of 18 % amounted to CHF 49 million.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Increasing ordinary dividend</strong></p><p align="justify">In-line with the financial performance, the Board of Directors will propose a CHF 3.55 ordinary dividend per share (a 69 % pay-out ratio) at the next General Meeting on 18 April 2018 translating into a 3 %, or CHF 0.10, increase compared to last year. The dividend will be split in two components: CHF 3.00 will be paid out of reserves from capital contributions and, therefore, will not be subject to Swiss withholding tax. The remaining CHF 0.55 will be paid from retained earnings as the reserves from capital contributions will be depleted.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>New partnerships in auto leasing and credit cards</strong></p><p align="justify">The Group recently signed a number of new partnerships. In the auto leases and loans business, Cembra signed a financing cooperation with Tesla in Switzerland. Following the acquisition of EFL Autoleasing, the Bank is now the captive finance partner for Hyundai and since 1 January 2018 Cembra is the captive finance partner for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Beginning February 2018, the Group introduced Samsung Pay as a mobile payment solution for four of its credit card programmes. Furthermore, and starting in April this year, the Group will launch a cooperation with the furniture store Interio, which belongs to the Migros group. An Interio branded credit card will be launched (based on Cumulus Mastercard) and a point of sales invoice solution will be developed in the second half of 2018.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Outlook for 2018</strong></p><p align="justify">Assuming no major change in the current economic environment, the Group is expecting earnings per share between CHF 4.80 and CHF 5.10 for the financial year of 2018. Additional revenues from the recent acquisitions and the ongoing growth of the credit cards business are expected to offset the impact of the rate cap on interest income in the personal loans business. Operating expenses are expected to increase driven by higher headcount and further investment in the digitalisation of the business, translating into a healthy but slightly higher cost/income ratio. Loss performance is expected to be in line with prior years.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">All documents (investor presentation and the media release) are available at www.cembra.ch/en/investor.</p>				</div>

				<div class="body">
	<p align="justify">Zurich – Cembra Money Bank’s (Ticker: CMBN) net financing receivables increased by 2% to CHF 4.2 billion with all products contributing to the overall growth. Both loss performance and costs were stable and in-line with expectations. Net income for the first half-year 2017 was 3% lower at CHF 69.4 million, or CHF 2.46 per share, on the back of the lower interest rate cap. This translated into an annualised return on average shareholders’ equity of 16.9% while maintaining a strong capital position with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 20.2%.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, commented: "The interest rate reduction has influenced net interest income as expected. Cembra was prepared for this change and was able to increase other revenues. In the first six months of 2017 we have delivered on our medium-term targets and we are confirming our guidance for the full-year."</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="left"><strong>Lower interest income partially offset by strong fee and commission income</strong></p><p align="justify">Net revenues decreased by 3% to CHF 192.3 million. Net interest income, which accounted for 72 % of net revenues, declined by 8% to CHF 138.6 million, translating into a net interest margin of 6.7%. Interest income was 8% lower driven by the implementation of the interest rate caps and by the costs-for-cash held at the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Interest expense reduced by 11% as the Bank continued to benefit from the low-negative interest environment. Commissions and fee income, which contributed 28% to net revenues, was up 14% to CHF 53.8 million, mainly driven by strong credit cards fee income. Provision for losses on financing receivables came in at CHF 21.1 million, translating into a loss rate of 1.0% in-line with prior periods.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Total operating expenses declined by 2% to CHF 83.3 million. Personnel expenses were up 2% to CHF 50.7 million as a result of higher headcount whilst general and administrative expenses of CHF 32.6 million were 7% lower mainly due to lower marketing and rental costs. Consequently, the cost/income ratio slightly increased to 43.3%. Income before taxes decreased by 3% to CHF 87.9 million translating into a net income of CHF 69.4 million after tax or CHF 2.46 per share.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>All products contributed to the financing receivables growth</strong></p><p align="justify">Despite a subdued consumer finance market, the Bank’s net financing receivables increased by 2% to CHF 4,171 million with growth across all products. Receivables in the personal loan business increased by 1% to CHF 1,738 million compared to year-end 2016. Interest income of 84.2 million was 15% lower due to lower interest rates leading to a 9.6% yield.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">The Swiss auto market was stable in the first half of 2017. The market for used cars was in-line with previous year whilst new car registrations developed positively. The Bank’s net financing receivables of the auto leases and loans business increased by 1% to CHF 1,658 mil­lion in-line with market trends. Interest income reduced by 1% to CHF 41.4 million generating a 5.0% yield.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Net financing receivables in the credit cards business recorded a strong growth of 9% reaching CHF 772 million by end June 2017. The increase was driven by the increase in the number of cards issued, by higher average spending and by the increase in the number of transactions. Interest income in the cards business increased by 9% to CHF 27.2 million with a 7.3% yield. The number of credit cards issued increased by 6 %, or 41,000, to circa 768,000.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Strong balance sheet</strong></p><p align="justify">The Bank further optimised its funding portfolio in-line with its strategy. The average remaining maturity was increased to 2.9 years and the period-end funding cost was reduced from 66 basis points to 62 basis points. In June 2017 the Bank raised CHF 150 million through a senior unsecured bond with a coupon of 0.375% and eight years maturity. Funding from retail and institutional clients reached an aggregate CHF 2,356 million. Overall, the funding mix remained stable with 59% deposits and 41% non-deposits.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Shareholders’ equity decreased by 6% to CHF 794 million by end of June 2017 as a result of the dividend payments of CHF 125.5 million in May. Cembra Money Bank remains very well capitalised with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 20.2% and a leverage ratio of 15.6%.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Business development</strong></p><p align="justify">Beginning of March 2017, the Bank successfully completed the acquisition of Swissbilling, an invoice financing provider based in Switzerland. In the first six months of 2017, Swissbilling financed about 190,000 invoices with a volume of circa CHF 23 million. The number of merchants grew to more than 280.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">On 21 July 2017, the Bank signed an agreement to refinance a CHF 42 million personal loan portfolio from eny Finance AG, a Swiss pure online personal loan provider. The Bank also has agreed to partially finance future personal loan volume. The financing deal will be structured via a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that will be fully owned, controlled and consolidated by Cembra Money Bank. eny Finance AG will remain an independent player in the Swiss personal loan market and continue originating assets in accordance with its&#160;own policies.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Outlook for full-year 2017</strong></p><p align="justify">The Bank confirms the original guidance provided in February 2017 with earnings per share of between CHF 4.70 and CHF 5.00 for the full-year. Lower net interest income following the introduction of the rate caps in July 2016 is expected to be partially offset by the continued growth in the credit cards business. Loss performance is expected to be in-line with prior years. Cost discipline with continued investments in digitisation will lead to a slightly higher cost/income ratio for the full-year 2017.</p><p align="left">&#160;</p><p align="left">All documents (half year report 2017, investor presentation and this media release) are available at <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/en/investor">www.cembra.ch/en/investor</a>.</p><p align="left">　</p><p align="left">　</p><p align="left"><strong>Contacts</strong></p><p align="left">Media:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Andreas Werz; +41 (0)44 439 8512; <a href="mailto:andreas.werz@cembra.ch">andreas.werz@cembra.ch</a></p><p align="left">Investor Relations: Christian Waelti; +41 (0)44 439 8572; <a href="mailto:christian.waelti@cembra.ch">christian.waelti@cembra.ch</a></p><p align="left">&#160;</p><p align="left"><strong>Key dates</strong></p><p align="left">22 February 2018&#160; &#160;Publication of full-year 2017 results</p><p align="left">18 April 2018&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;Annual General Meeting 2018</p><p align="left">&#160;</p><p align="left"><strong>Audio webcast and telephone conference for investors/analysts (in English)</strong></p><p align="left">Date and time:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;25 July 2017 at 09.00 a.m. CET</p><p align="left">Speakers:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;Robert Oudmayer (CEO), Rémy Schimmel (CFO) and Volker Gloe (CRO)</p><p align="left">Audio webcast:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;<a href="http://www.cembra.ch/en/investor">www.cembra.ch/en/investor</a></p><p align="left">Telephone:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Europe: +41 (0)58 310 50 00</p><p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;UK: +44 (0)203 059 58 62</p><p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;US: +1 (1)631 570 5613</p><p align="left">Q&#x26;A session:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Following the presentation participants will have the opportunity to ask questions via the telephone conference.&#160;Please dial in 10–15 minutes before the start of the presentation and ask for "Cembra’s half-year 2017 results".</p><p align="left">&#160;</p>				</div>

				<div class="body">
	<p align="justify">Zurich – Cembra Money Bank (Ticker: CMBN) achieved in 2016 a net income of CHF 143.7 million or CHF 5.10 earnings per share. This represents a return on average shareholders’ equity (ROE) of 17.4% while maintaining a strong capital position with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 20.0%. A total dividend distribution of CHF 4.45 will be proposed to the General Meeting including an extraordinary dividend of CHF 1.00. Net financing receivables remained stable at CHF 4.1 billion with a shift from personal loans to credit cards.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, said: "Against the backdrop of regulatory headwinds we achieved again a&#160;strong result in 2016. We made substantial progress in the business development with the early extension of the Migros contract, the addition of Fnac to our credit card partners and the acquisition of SWISSBILLING. Furthermore, we decided to refine the capital policy to provide more line of sight for investors while keeping flexibility for arising growth opportunities."</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Strong fee and commission income development</strong></p><p align="justify">Net revenues increased by 1% to CHF 394.0 million compared to CHF 388.7 million in 2015. Net interest income, which accounts for 76 % of net revenues, declined 1% to CHF 297.7 million, translating into a net interest margin of 7.2%. Interest income was 4 % lower driven by the impact of the lower interest rate cap and by the costs for cash held at the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Interest expense reduced 27% driven by lower refinancing cost and by the repayment of the term loan from General Electric. Commissions and fee income, which contributed 24% to net revenues, was up 11% to CHF 96.3 million, mainly driven by strong credit cards fee income and higher insurance profit share. Provision for losses came in at CHF 44.6 million translating into a loss rate of 1.1% of financing receivables which was in line with 2015 performance. Cembra Money Bank’s prudent risk management approach was reflected in the stable and low delinquency levels: 1.8% for 30+ days past due and 0.4% for non-performing loans (NPL).</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Total operating expenses increased 4 % to CHF 167.5 million. Personnel expenses increased by 1 % to CHF 100.4 million on the back of higher pension cost as a result of a lower discount rate. General and administrative expenses of CHF 67.1 million were 9 % higher mainly due to an increase in IT and depreciation costs after the successful completion of the IT migration to a stand-alone platform by end-2015. The Bank continued to invest in digitizing the business as demonstrated by the stable headcount despite a 7 % increase in the number of customers to 748,000. As a result of the lower rate cap the Bank also initiated cost saving measures and reduced the number of branches by seven to today 18 overall. This resulted in a cost/income ratio of 42.5 %. Income before taxes decreased by 1% to CHF 181.9 million which with 21 % effective tax rate led to a strong net income of CHF 143.7 million or CHF 5.10 per share.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Capitalising on low rate environment</strong></p><p align="justify">Cembra Money Bank continued to further optimise its funding profile. The attractive term deposit rate offering enabled the Bank to increase deposits from retail and institutional clients to an aggregate CHF 2,355 million. Deposits accounted for 61 % of total funding by end-2016. The Bank successfully tapped the capital market and raised CHF 200 million through an auto lease asset backed security (ABS) transaction and another CHF 200 million through an unsecured bond, both at favourable conditions. The average funding cost was reduced from 82 basis points to 66 basis points. In the course of 2016, the Bank also fully repaid the remaining CHF 250 million term loan from&#160;General Electric and is today 100 % independently funded.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Shift towards credit cards</strong></p><p align="justify">Despite a subdued Swiss credit market the Bank’s net financing receivables increased slightly by CHF 10 million to CHF 4,073 million. Receivables in the Bank’s personal loan business decreased by 4% to CHF 1,720 million compared to year-end 2015 in a consumer loan market which declined for the seventh consecutive year. Interest income of 191.3 million was 8% lower due to lower volume and due to lower interest rate leading to a 10.7% yield.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">The Swiss auto market came back to normality in 2016 after strong growth in 2015 on the back of the EUR/CHF de-peg. While new car registrations slightly regressed, the market for used cars developed positively. The Bank’s net financing receivables of the auto leases and loans portfolio decreased by 1% to CHF 1,641 mil­lion. Interest income reduced by 2% to CHF 83.5 million with a 5.0% yield.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Net financing receivables in the credit cards business recorded a strong growth of 15 % reaching CHF 711 million by year-end 2016. The increase was driven by the increase in the number of cards, by higher average spending and by the increase in the number of transactions. Interest income in the cards business increased by 13 % to CHF 51.6 million and the corresponding yield was stable at 7.7 %. The number of credit cards issued increased by 11 % to circa 727,000.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Business development sets base for future growth</strong></p><p align="justify">In 2016, Cembra Money Bank made significant progress in securing the development of its growing credit cards business. The cooperation agreement with the credit card partner Migros was extended prior to expiry for another five year term until 2022 with an expected go-live of the next card generation around mid-2017. Additionally, the contract with Conforama was successfully extended and Fnac, a new retail partner, was launched in November 2016.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Entering invoice financing business</strong></p><p align="justify">On 16 February 2017, Cembra Money Bank reached an agreement to acquire 100 % of the shares of SWISSBILLING SA, a Swiss-based invoice financing company with operations mainly in the French speaking region of Switzerland. SwissBilling began operations in 2012 and targets primarily online merchants and consumers with its "payment by invoice" product. Payment by invoice remains the most prevalent means of payment for shopping online in Switzerland with over 80% of online volume being paid by invoice. Thanks to this acquisition, Cembra Money Bank gains access to a best-in-class technology platform that will enable it to provide financing to a broader range of the Swiss consumer base. SWISSBILLING will continue to operate under the SWISSBILLING brand and as an independent entity within the Cembra Money Bank Group.</p><p align="justify">　</p><p align="justify"><strong>Refining the capital policy and proposing a total dividend of CHF 4.45 per share</strong></p><p align="justify">The Board of Directors decided to refine the existing capital policy with regards to the deployment of excess capital. Going forward, Cembra Money Bank intends to return excess Tier 1 capital above c.20% to shareholders either via extraordinary dividends or share buybacks unless there is a more efficient allocation of capital – in particular for internal or external growth. The target pay-out ratio for the ordinary dividend of 60–70% of net income remains unchanged.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Reflecting on the Bank’s strong financial results, the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2017 a 3%, or 10 cents, higher ordinary dividend per share of CHF 3.45 which equals to a pay-out ratio of 68% of net income. The ordinary dividend will be paid out of reserves from capital contributions and, therefore, will not be subject to Swiss withholding tax.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Furthermore, and applying the newly introduced capital policy, the Board of Directors has decided to return excess capital of approximately CHF 28 million to shareholders. The additional distribution is returned to shareholders by means of an extraordinary dividend of CHF 1.00 per share which will be paid from retained earnings, resulting in a total dividend of CHF 4.45 for the financial year 2016.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Strongly capitalised Bank</strong></p><p align="justify">Shareholders’ equity increased 6% to CHF 848 million by year-end 2016. With a Tier 1 capital ratio of 20.0% Cembra Money Bank remains very well capitalised. Compared to the Bank’s self-imposed minimum Tier 1 target of 18%, the excess capital amounts to CHF 76 million.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Outlook for 2017</strong></p><p align="justify">Overall, 2017 net revenue is expected to slightly decrease due to the reduction in net interest income, following the introduction of the rate caps in July 2016, partially offset by the increase in fee and commission income on the back of the continued growth of the credit card business. Additionally, and whilst keeping a strong focus on the cost discipline, the Bank will continue to further invest in the digitalization of the business leading to a slightly higher cost/income ratio compared to 2016. Loss performance is expected to be in line with prior years. Assuming no major change in the current environment, the Bank is expecting earnings per share of between CHF 4.70 and CHF 5.00 for the financial year of 2017.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">All documents (investor presentation and this media release) are available at <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/en/investor">www.cembra.ch/en/investor</a>.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><hr /><p align="justify"><strong>Contacts</strong></p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border: currentColor;

				<div class="body">
	<p><span>All SWISSBILLING employees will be retained and the existing relationships of the company with its customers will not be affected by the acquisition. SWISSBILLING will continue to operate as an independent entity within the Group under its own name. The current management of SWISSBILLING will continue to be actively involved in the business. The transaction consideration was below CHF 10 million and is expected to have a negative impact of 0.1% on the Group’s CET1 ratio as at closing. The transaction is expected to close within the first quarter of 2017.<br /><br />Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer of Cembra Money Bank, said: “SWISSBILLING has established itself as an up and coming player in the invoice financing market in Switzerland. SWISSBILLING will enable Cembra to expand the product offering to retailers and merchants. Next to personal loans and credit cards, their customers can also benefit from invoice financing solutions.”</span></p>				</div>

				<div class="body">
	<p><span>Zurich – For the first half-year 2016 Cembra Money Bank reports a 3 % increase in net income to CHF 71.8 million or CHF 2.55 per share. This reflects an annualised return on average shareholders’ equity (ROE) of 18.2 % while maintaining a strong capital position with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 20.1 %. Costs remained well under control as demonstrated by the competitive cost/income ratio of 42.9 %. With net financing receivables expanding by 1 % to CHF 4.1 billion, Cembra Money Bank was able to outperform Swiss GDP growth.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Our Bank achieved the best first half-year results since the IPO in 2013 despite a challenging economic environment. The Bank remains strongly capitalised and is now 100 % stand-alone funded.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Strong first half-year results</span></strong></p><p><span>Net revenues increased by 4 % to CHF 197.4 million compared to first half-year 2015, driven by both interest and commission and fee income. Net interest income, which accounts for 76 % of net revenues, was up 2 % to CHF 150.3 million, reflecting a net interest margin of 7.3 %. Interest income was down 2 % driven by the business mix and costs for cash held at the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Interest expense fell 28 % on favorable repricing of the Bank’s liabilities and the partial repayment of the GE term loan. Commissions and fee income, which contributes 24 % to net revenues, was up 10 % to CHF 47.1 million, mainly driven by strong credit cards fee income and higher insurance profit share. Provision for losses came in at CHF 21.7 million translating into a loss rate of 1.05 % of financing receivables which is in line with 2015 performance. Cembra Money Bank’s prudent risk management approach was reflected in stable delinquencies at low levels: 2.0 % for 30+ days past due and 0.4 % for non-performing loans (NPL).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Total operating expenses were 4 % higher at CHF 84.8 million. Personnel expenses increased by 2 % to CHF 49.9 million as a result of higher pension cost. General and administrative expenses of CHF 34.9 million were 7 % up due to an increase in IT and depreciation costs after the successful completion of the IT separation end of 2015. This resulted in a competitive cost/income ratio of 42.9 %. Income before taxes increased by 3 % to CHF 90.9 million. With an unchanged tax rate of approximately 21 %, this led to a strong net income of CHF 71.8 million representing an increase of 3 % compared to first half-year 2015.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Fully independently funded</span></strong></p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank continued to further diversify its funding. Owing to the attractive term deposit rate offering the Bank has been able to increase deposits from both retail (up 8 %) and institutional clients (up 1 %) to an aggregate CHF 2,324 million. Deposits now account for 62 % of total funding. In June 2016, the Bank successfully executed its fourth auto lease asset backed security (ABS) transaction of CHF 200 million at favorable conditions. The Bank also fully repaid the remaining CHF 250 million term loan from the General Electric Group in two steps during January and July. With that the Bank is now 100 % independently funded.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Strongly capitalised Bank</span></strong></p><p><span>Shareholders’ equity decreased slightly to CHF 779 million by end of June 2016 as a result of the CHF 94.5 million dividend payment in May. With a Tier 1 capital ratio of 20.1 % Cembra Money Bank remains very well capitalised. Compared to the Bank’s minimum Tier 1 target of 18 %, excess capital amounts to CHF 78 million. The Bank prefers to use that capital for acquisitions in the consumer finance space to support the growth of the business.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Continued strong growth in the cards business</span></strong></p><p><span>Despite resilient private consumption in Switzerland the consumer loan market continued to decline in the first half-year 2016. Receivables in the Bank’s personal loan business decreased by 2 % to CHF 1,756 million compared to year-end 2015. Revenues reduced in line with the receivables development to CHF 98.7 million. As the Bank kept its pricing stable until May, the yield was&#160;virtually unchanged at 10.9 %.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>After a very strong growth development in 2015 the Swiss auto market stabilised in the first six months of 2016. While new car registrations slightly regressed the market for used cars developed positively. The Bank’s net financing receivables of the auto leases and loans portfolio increased by 1 % to CHF 1,670 million. Interest income fell by 3 % to CHF 41.8 million and the yield was 5.0 %.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Cards again recorded excellent growth with net financing receivables increasing by 9 % to CHF 673&#160;million compared to year-end 2015. Revenues in the cards business increased supported by higher cross-border transactions and the overall growing portfolio. Interest income of CHF 25.0 million was 14 % higher than in the first half-year 2015 and the yield rose to 7.7 %. All credit card programs contributed to the 6 % increase in the number of issued cards to 693,000 (compared to year-end 2015). Furthermore, the partnership with Conforama was renewed and FNAC, a retailer of entertainment and leisure products and consumer electronics, was signed as new credit card partner.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>New interest rates for consumer loans</span></strong></p><p><span>On 11 December 2015, the Federal Council decided to decrease the maximum interest rate on consumer loans offered under the Consumer Credit Act from 15 % to 10 %. The respective maximum interest rate for credit card overdraft was reduced to 12 %. This decision came into force as of 1 July 2016 for all new contracts entered thereafter. Cembra Bank has adapted the pricing of its loan products accordingly and offers personal loans starting from 7.95 %. Also the pricing for some of the smaller credit card programmes has been adjusted. In order to mitigate the potential consequences the Bank has defined a set of measures. Some of them will be introduced in the short and medium-term, others have already been implemented. The Bank decided for example to close four smaller branches as of 1 May 2016.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Full-year 2016 guidance</span></strong></p><p><span>Assuming no major change in the economic environment, Cembra Money Bank expects earnings per share (EPS) at the higher end of the guided range of between CHF 4.80 and CHF 5.10. For full-year 2016, interest income in the personal loans business is expected to decline as a result of the interest rate cap effective since July 2016. On the other hand, lower refinancing costs and continued growth in the credit card business should be supportive to revenues. For loan loss provisions a stable development is foreseen and the loss rate is expected to be in line with prior years’ performance. Costs are expected to increase slightly for 2016.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>All documents (half-year report 2016, investor presentation, letter to shareholders and this media release) are available at <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/en/investor">www.cembra.ch/en/investor</a>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border: currentColor;

	<p><span>Zurich – Cembra Money Bank (Ticker: CMBN) reports for the full-year 2015 a 4 </span><span>% increase in consolidated net income to CHF 145.0 million or CHF 5.04 per share<sup>1</sup>. This reflects a return on average shareholders’ equity<sup>2</sup> of 17.7 </span><span>% while maintaining a strong capital position with a Tier-1 capital ratio<sup>3</sup> of 19.8 </span><span>% after a CHF 100 million share buyback. Costs remained well under control as demonstrated by the solid cost/income ratio<sup>4</sup> of 41.5 </span><span>%. Net financing receivables were stable at CHF 4.1 billion.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer, said: “2015 has been a very successful year for Cembra Money Bank, both operationally and financially. On the one hand, we finalised the IT migration from GE to a stand-alone platform after two years of hard work. On the other hand, we kept focused on the daily business and delivered the best results since being a public company.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Commission and fee income growing double-digit</span></strong></p><p><span>Net revenues increased by 2 </span><span>% to CHF 388.7 million compared to CHF 379.4 million in 2014. Net interest income, which accounts for 78 </span><span>% of net revenues, was up CHF 0.9 million to CHF 301.9 million, reflecting a net interest margin<sup>5</sup> of 7.3 </span><span>%. Interest income was down 1% to CHF 338.3 million driven by costs for cash held at the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and lower income in the personal loans and auto business. This was offset by higher interest income from the credit cards business and the 13 </span><span>% decline in interest expense as a result of the favorable repricing of the Bank’s liabilities. Commissions and fee income, which contributes 22 </span><span>% to net revenues, was up 11 </span><span>% to CHF 86.7 million, mainly driven by an 18 </span><span>% increase in credit cards fee income. Provisions for losses came in at CHF 43.6 million translating into a loss rate<sup>6</sup> of 1.06 </span><span>% of financing receivables. Delinquencies remained stable at low levels of 1.8 </span><span>% for 30+ days past due<sup>7</sup> and 0.4 </span><span>% for non-performing loans<sup>8</sup>, reflecting the Bank’</span><span>s prudent risk management approach.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Costs well under control with cost/income ratio of 41.5%</span></strong></p><p><span>Total operating expenses were flat at CHF 161.5 million with some changes in composition. Personnel expenses increased by 4 </span><span>% or CHF 3.9 million to CHF 99.8 million as a result of higher pension cost and increased headcount due to the IT migration project. General and administrative expenses of CHF 61.7 million were 6 </span><span>% or CHF 3.8 million lower than in 2014. This decrease is mainly attributable to reduced TSA (fees paid to GE) and consulting costs after the successful completion of the IT separation. This resulted in a solid cost/income ratio of 41.5 </span><span>%. Income before taxes increased by 4 </span><span>% to CHF 183.6 million. With an unchanged tax rate of approximately 21 </span><span>%, this led to a net income of CHF 145.0 million representing an increase of 4 </span><span>% or CHF 5.1 million compared to 2014.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Strong inflows from institutional and retail depositors</span></strong></p><p><span>The Bank remained an attractive counterparty to place money with and recorded strong inflows in institutional and retail deposits which grew by 16 </span><span>% to CHF 2,246 million and made up for 59 </span><span>% of total funding. The cash on the balance sheet of CHF 572 million was almost entirely held at SNB, on which the Bank incurred a charge of CHF 2.0 million for the full-year 2015.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Shareholders’ equity decreased 5 </span><span>% to CHF 799 million as a result of the CHF 100 million share buyback and the CHF 93 million dividend payment. With unchanged risk-weighted assets of CHF 3,703 million and eligible Tier-1 capital of CHF 733 million, the Tier-1 capital ratio reached a strong 19.8 </span><span>% by year-end 2015. Excess</span> <span>capital above the Bank’s minimum 18 </span><span>% Tier-1 target amounted to CHF 66 million.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Growth in credit cards receivables offsetting decline in personal loans</span></strong></p><p><span>In a continuously decreasing market environment, receivables in the personal loans business declined 4 % to CHF 1,784 million. In line with the receivables development, interest income of CHF 207.9 million was 3 % lower in 2015 than in 2014. As the Bank kept its pricing unchanged, the yield<sup>9</sup></span> <span>remained stable at 11.2 %.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The revaluation of the Swiss Franc had a significant impact on the Swiss auto market. New car registrations as well as used car transactions benefited from lower prices and reached new multi-year highs. Despite aggressive pricing of competitors, financing receivables remained unchanged at CHF 1,661 million. Interest income fell by 3 </span><span>% to CHF 85.4 million as a result of lower rates offered in the market. However, the Bank was able to keep its yield above 5 </span><span>%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The credit card business continued on its growth path with net financing receivables increasing by 11 </span><span>% to CHF 617 million compared to year-end 2014. Interest income of CHF 45.7 million was 15 </span><span>% or CHF 6.0 million higher than in 2014. The yield slightly increased to 7.7 </span><span>%. The number of issued cards increased by 8 </span><span>% to 655,000, mainly driven by the Cumulus-MasterCard.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>8 </span><span>% higher dividend of CHF 3.35 per share proposed</span></strong></p><p><span>Based on the solid results and the strong capital position, the Bank’s Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2016 an 8 </span><span>%, or 25 cents, higher dividend per share of CHF 3.35. The dividend will be paid out of reserves from capital contributions and, therefore, will not be subject to Swiss withholding tax. The dividend reflects a pay-out ratio of 66 </span><span>% of net income. The Bank intends not to pay dividends on the approximately 1.8 million shares bought back in May 2015 and held as treasury shares.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Lower interest rate cap for consumer loans</span></strong></p><p><span>The Federal Council decided in December 2015 to reduce the maximum interest rate on consumer loans offered under the Consumer Credit Act (CCA) to 10 </span><span>% for personal loans and to 12 </span><span>% for credit card overdrafts. The corresponding amendment of the ordinance to the CCA will enter into force as of 1 July 2016 for all new contracts entered thereafter. The Bank has initiated a set of measures to mitigate the financial consequences and is also working on other business initiatives.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Guidance for 2016</span></strong></p><p><span>Due to&#160;the reduction of the maximum interest rate cap effective mid-2016, revenues in the personal loans business are expected to decline, but should be partially offset by continued growth in the credit card business and lower refinancing costs.</span> <span>Loan loss provisions are expected to be in line with prior years’ performance.&#160;</span><span>Costs are expected to increase slightly driven by pension costs and a higher IT run-rate. Based on these factors, the Bank is expecting reported earnings per share of between CHF 4.80 and CHF 5.10<sup>10</sup></span> <span>for the financial year 2016.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Katrina&#160;Machin and Ben Tellings proposed for election to the Board of Directors</span></strong></p><p><span>The Board of Directors of Cembra Money Bank will propose to the next Annual General Meeting on</span> <span>27 April 2016 the election of Katrina&#160;Machin (also known as Cliffe)&#160;and Simonis Maria Hubertus (“Ben”) Tellings as new members to the Board of Directors.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>British citizen Katrina&#160;Machin has spent 20 years of her career in the financial services industry, specialising in consumer lending with companies such as American Express, Lloyds Banking Group, Goldfish Bank Ltd and MBNA International Bank. In 2014, she became a non-executive director with the online retail specialist Shop Direct Finance Company and in 2015 also took a non-executive directorship with ABTA, the UK’s largest travel association.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Dutch citizen Ben Tellings has an outstanding experience in consumer finance in several European countries with more than 20 years in different executive roles at ING Group. Since 2010, he is the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ING-DiBa AG in Germany, after having served as its Chief Executive Officer from 2003 until 2010.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Katrina&#160;Machin and Ben Tellings are nominated to replace Richard Laxer and Christopher M. Chambers in the Board of Directors of Cembra Money Bank. Mr. Laxer stepped down from his position as a member of the Board of Directors as of 1 September 2015. Mr. Chambers will not stand for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2016.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>All documents (investor presentation and this media release) are available at <a href="http://www.cembra.ch/en/investor">www.cembra.ch/en/investor</a></span><span>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border: currentColor;

Important factors that could cause those differences include, but are not limited to: changing business or other market conditions; legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments; general economic conditions in Switzerland, the European Union and elsewhere; and the Bank’s ability to respond to trends in the financial services industry.

	<p><span>Zürich – Rémy Schimmel has been appointed as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Cembra Money Bank. He will assume this position by 1 October 2016 at the latest and will become a member of the Bank’s Management Board.</span></p>				</div>



				<div class="body">
	<p><span>Rémy Schimmel brings a wealth of expertise for the CFO position. Since July 2010, the French national has held different key roles for Royal Bank of Scotland, since August 2014 as CFO of Coutts &#x26; Co Ltd in Zurich. He has wide-ranging experience in financial and risk management. Before joining Royal Bank of Scotland, he held positions with Lloyds Banking Group, General Electric and Kimberly-Clark in London (UK) and in Europe. The 41-year-old Rémy Schimmel holds a Master in International Trade from EICD (University of Lyon, France), a Master of Sciences in Economics from HEC Business School (University of Montreal, Canada) and is a Chartered Global Management Accountant (CIMA).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>“Rémy Schimmel is a seasoned finance executive, and we are very happy that he has decided to join us as our new CFO”, said Robert Oudmayer, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cembra Money Bank. “With his proven track record in the finance industry, Rémy Schimmel is a valuable addition to the Management Board of Cembra Money Bank.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank’s current CFO, Antoine Boublil, will leave the company on 31 March 2016 to assume the CFO position of the Swiss Universal Bank at Credit Suisse. He made an important contribution to Cembra Money Bank’s successful IPO in October 2013 and the positioning of the Bank as an independent player in the market thereafter.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Until Rémy Schimmel will take over his new position as CFO of Cembra Money Bank, Haldun Kuru will act as CFO ad interim for the Bank. Haldun Kuru is Head of Controllership of Cembra Money Bank since March 2011.</span></p>				</div>

	<p><span>Zurich, Switzerland – The Federal Council decided on 11 December 2015 to reduce the maximum interest rate on consumer loans offered under the Consumer Credit Act (CCA) from 15% to 10% (3-months LIBOR plus 10% surcharge); the respective maximum interest rate for credit card overdraft will be reduced to 12%.

This decision is likely to lead to a restriction of access to credit for some customers due to the risk based pricing approach applied by Cembra Money Bank (the ‘Bank’).</span></p>				</div>



				<div class="body">
	<p><span>The reduction of the maximum interest rate will have no impact on the results for the current financial year 2015. Therefore, the Bank is expecting reported earnings per share of between CHF 4.70 and CHF 4.90 for 2015 as announced previously.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>In order to mitigate the potential consequences, the Bank has defined a set of measures which will be introduced in the short and medium term. Taking into account these measures as well as the average contract duration of approximately three years on products affected by the CCA regulation, it is expected that the impact for the business year 2016 will be limited. Based on current information, and assuming all other things remain <span>equal, it will, however, have on a like for like basis compared to the mid-point of the 2015 earnings per share (EPS) guidance range (CHF 4.80) an estimated negative impact on EPS of</span> <span><span>10% or CHF 0.47 respectively, when fully phased in over the next 36 months. The Bank will seek, through other business initiatives, to further mitigate this negative impact.</span></span></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>In that context, and given the solid capital position of the Bank and the continuous buildup of excess capital above the tier 1 minimum target of 18%, the Board of Directors will reassess if necessary its pay-out target range in due course in order to ensure a sustainable dividend policy.</span></p>				</div>

				<div class="body">
	<p><span>Zurich, Switzerland – Cembra Money Bank reports for the first half-year 2015 an 8% increase in consolidated net income to CHF 69.6 million or CHF 2.37 per share<sup>1</sup>. This reflects an annualised return on average shareholders’ equity<sup>2</sup> of 17.7% while maintaining a strong capital position with a Tier 1 capital ratio<sup>3</sup> of 18.7% after the CHF 100 million share buyback executed in May 2015. Costs remained well under control as demonstrated by the solid cost/income ratio<sup>4</sup> of 42.8%. With net financing receivables growing by 1% to CHF 4.1 billion, Cembra Money Bank was able to outperform Swiss GDP growth.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Robert Oudmayer</span></strong><span>, Chief Executive Officer, said: “In a challenging environment, we showed excellent net income growth. We also managed to deliver on our medium term targets. Furthermore, our business transition from GE is well on track.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Growing commission and fee income combined with rigorous cost and risk management</span></strong></p><p><span>Compared to first half 2014, net revenues increased by 2% to CHF 190.3 million. Net interest income, which accounts for 77% of net revenues, was down 1% at CHF 147.3 million, reflecting a net interest margin</span><sup>5&#160;</sup><span>of 7.1%. Interest income was down 1% driven by costs of approximately CHF 1.5 million for cash held at the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Interest expense was down 3% on favorable repricing of the Bank’s liabilities. Commissions and fee income, which contributes 23% to net revenues, was 15% higher at CHF 43.0 million, mainly driven by a 26% increase in credit cards fee income. Provisions for losses came in at CHF 20.8 million translating into a loss rate<sup>6</sup> of 1.0% of financing receivables which is in-line with the guidance provided. Cembra Money Bank’s prudent risk management approach was reflected in stable delinquencies at low levels: 2.0% for 30+ days past due<sup>7</sup> and 0.5% for non-performing loans<sup>8</sup>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Total operating expenses were 2% lower at CHF 81.4 million. While personnel expenses increased by 2% to CHF 48.8 million as a result of higher pension cost, general and administrative expenses of CHF 32.5 million were 6% lower. This decrease is mainly attributable to timing effects related to the ongoing IT transition. General and administrative expenses also included CHF 3.4 million Swiss issuance stamp tax in connection with the sale of 9.5 million Cembra Money Bank shares by General Electric Company in May 2015. This resulted in a solid cost/income ratio of 42.8%. Income before taxes increased by 7% to CHF 88.1 million while the tax rate remained unchanged at approximately 21%. This led to a net income of CHF 69.6 million representing an increase of 8% compared to first half 2014.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Substantial inflows from institutional and retail depositors</span></strong></p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank recorded substantial inflows in institutional and retail deposits which grew by 11 </span><span>% to CHF 2,163 million and made up for 55 </span><span>% of total funding in June. In March, the Bank successfully executed its third auto asset backed security (ABS) transaction of CHF 200 million with maturity of four years at favorable conditions. The cash on the balance sheet of CHF 534 million (down 14 </span><span>% compared to year-end 2014) was almost entirely at SNB.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Shareholders’ equity decreased 13% to CHF 736 million as a result of the CHF 100 million share buyback and the CHF 93 million dividend payment. With risk-weighted assets of CHF 3,730 million (up 1% versus year-end 2014) and eligible Tier 1 capital of CHF 699 million, the Tier 1 capital ratio reached a strong 18.7% by end-June 2015.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Antoine Boublil</span></strong><span>, Chief Financial Officer, commented: “We are tracking ahead of our funding plan with a strong growth in deposits, which enabled us to complete the repayment of our IPO syndicate loan and of CHF 200 million of GE funding, both executed in July 2015. Besides, following our share buyback in May, we accumulated CHF 27 million of excess capital as of the end of June.“</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Growth in net financing receivables driven by credit cards</span></strong></p><p><span>In an again slightly decreasing market, Personal loans was able to consolidate its strong market position keeping receivables almost flat at CHF 1,840 million. Interest income was 2% lower at CHF 103.7 million compared to first half 2014. As of 1 July 2015, the branch and agent operations have been reorganized and divided into regions to serve clients more efficiently.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>The revaluation of the Swiss Franc had a significant impact on the Swiss auto market. While new car registrations benefited from lower import prices, used car transactions in Switzerland were flat in the first six months of 2015. Net financing receivables increased slightly to CHF 1,668 million and interest income fell by 2% to CHF 42.9 million as a result of lower rates offered in the market, compared to first half 2014.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Credit cards again recorded strong growth with net financing receivables increasing by 7% to CHF 595 million compared to year-end 2014. Interest income of CHF 21.8 million was 17% higher than in the corresponding period 2014. All credit card programs contributed to the 3% increase in the number of issued cards to 626,000 (compared to year-end 2014).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Increasing full-year 2015 guidance</span></strong></p><p><span>Given the seasonality in Cembra Money Bank’s business and assuming no major change in the economic environment, net revenue for the second half-year 2015 should exceed first half-year net revenue. Funding costs are expected to benefit from the repayment of loans signed at the time of the IPO and the low interest rate environment.

	<p><span>Zurich, Switzerland – Cembra Money Bank reports for its first year as a stand-alone bank a 5% increase in consolidated net income to CHF 139.9 million or CHF 4.67 per share<sup>1</sup>. This positive result translates into a return on average shareholders’ equity<sup>2</sup> of 17.0% while maintaining a very strong capital position with a Tier 1 capital ratio<sup>3</sup> of 20.6%. Costs remained well under control reflected in a solid cost/income ratio<sup>4</sup> of 42.5%. With net financing receivables growing by 2% to CHF 4.1 billion, Cembra Money Bank was able to outperform its markets in all key product lines.</span></p>				</div>



				<div class="body">
	<p><span><strong>Robert Oudmayer</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, said: “Our first year as a stand-alone Bank was very exciting but at the same time also very challenging. We have been able to manage the massive business transition successfully as underpinned by the operating results 2014. Our new brand is well perceived and our customer focus highly appreciated. Therefore, we have gained market share. We will continue to adapt our business to potential future regulatory changes and drive our sustainable growth.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Sustainable revenue increase coupled with rigorous cost and risk management</span></strong></p><p><span>Compared to 2013, net revenues increased by 7% to CHF 379.4 million, driven by both net interest income as well as commission and fee income. Net interest income, which accounts for 79% of net revenues, was 7% higher at CHF 301.0 million, reflecting a net interest margin<sup>5</sup> of 7.4%. The main reason for the increase in net interest income was the 32% lower funding costs due to changes in the funding mix (reaching 87% local funding). Commissions and fee income, which contributes 21% to net revenues, was 9% higher at CHF 78.4 million, driven by 21% higher credit cards fee income. Provisions for losses came in at CHF 40.9 million translating into a loss rate<sup>6</sup> of 1.0% of financing receivables which is in-line with the guidance.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Total operating expenses were 10% lower at CHF 161.4 million. Adjusted for IPO-related one-time cost incurred in 2013 of CHF 23.3 million, operating expense increased by 4%. While personnel expenses decreased by 4% to CHF 95.9 million as a result of lower pension cost and productivity increase, general and administrative expenses reached CHF 65.5 million mainly due to the on-going business separation from GE. This resulted in a solid cost/income ratio of 42.5%. Income before taxes increased by 5% to CHF 177.2 million while the tax rate remained unchanged at approximately 21%. This led to a net income of CHF 139.9 million representing an increase of 5% compared to 2013. As expected, due to the seasonality of the business and the release of a provision created in connection with an examination by FINMA, second half net income (CHF 75.2 million) was stronger than first half (CHF 64.7 million).</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank’s prudent risk management approach was reflected in stable delinquencies at low levels: 1.8% for 30+ days past due<sup>7</sup> and 0.4% for non-performing loans<sup>8</sup>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Further diversification of funding based on broad investors’ confidence</span></strong></p><p><span>Institutional and retail deposits grew by 17% to CHF 1,941 million, reflecting investor’s confidence into Cembra Money Bank as a stand-alone Bank. In the second half of 2014, the Bank successfully placed CHF 200 million senior unsecured bonds in long maturities at attractive rates and amended some of its bank loans at favourable conditions. Funding from former parent GE Capital was reduced further to CHF 500 million translating into a stand-alone funding ratio of 87%.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Shareholders’ equity increased by 5% to CHF 842 million as a result of the CHF 139.9 million net income for full-year 2014, partially offset by CHF 85.5 million dividend payment in May 2014. With risk-weighted assets of CHF 3,689 million (up 3% versus year-end 2013) and eligible Tier 1 capital of CHF 760 million, the Tier 1 capital ratio reached a high 20.6% by year-end 2014.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Strengthening market position in all product lines</span></strong></p><p><span>In a slightly decreasing market, Personal loans was able to consolidate its market position keeping receivables flat at CHF 1,855 million. Interest income was 2% lower at CHF 214.3 million compared to 2013.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>While new car registrations and used car transactions in Switzerland declined by approximately 2% each in 2014, Auto leases and loans product line was able to capitalize on the rebranding and the opening of regional service centers. Net financing receivables increased by 1% to CHF 1,662 million and interest income fell by 5% to CHF 88.2 million as a result of lower rates offered in the market, compared to 2013.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Cards again recorded strong growth with net financing receivables increasing by 15% to CHF 556 million compared to year-end 2013. Interest income of CHF 39.7 million was 23% higher than in the previous year. The number of issued credit cards grew by 10% to 606’000 (compared to year-end 2013) with the Cumulus MasterCard being the main driver.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Concluded FINMA proceedings without business implications</span></strong></p><p><span>In December 2014 FINMA concluded regulatory proceedings with regards to the Bank’s collaboration with a former external credit agent. Other than the CHF 1.5 million legal and procedural cost accounted for in 2014, there were no further financial or business implications.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Attractive dividend proposal and share buyback</span></strong></p><p><span>Based on its strong capital position Cembra Money Bank’s Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2015 a 9% higher dividend per share of CHF 3.10 to be paid out of reserves from capital contributions. The distribution will therefore not be subject to Swiss withholding tax. The dividend reflects a pay-out ratio of 66% of net income.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Besides, given the significant excess capital position beyond its Tier 1 capital ratio target of 18% the Bank has accumulated, the Board of Directors has given its approval to use up to CHF 100 million excess capital to buy back shares in case of a liquidity event by a major shareholder.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span><strong>Antoine Boublil</strong>, Chief Financial Officer, commented: “We have exceeded all of our short-term and medium-term financial targets for our first full year as stand-alone bank. Our funding transition is tracking ahead of our plan and we finished the year with a very strong capital position. The increased dividend proposal and the CHF 100 million share buyback authorisation illustrate our capacity to enhance returns to our shareholders.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Monica Mächler proposed for election to the Board of Directors</span></strong></p><p><span>The Board of Directors will propose to the next Annual General Meeting the election of Monica Mächler (Swiss citizen) to the Board of Directors. Mrs. Mächler brings substantial legal, regulatory and governance expertise in a national and international context. She has held key positions at Zurich Insurance Group (1990–2006) and served as Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors to the integrated Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) from 2009 to 2012, after having been the Director of the Swiss Federal Office of Private Insurance (2007–2008). Mrs. Mächler is also a member of the Supervisory Board of Directors of Deutsche Börse AG, of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. and of Zurich Insurance Company Ltd.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Expected EPS of between CHF 4.50 and CHF 4.70 despite challenging environment</span></strong></p><p><span>For 2015, Cembra Money Bank is currently expecting interest rates to stay at historically low levels and therefore pricing pressure to remain in some of its business lines. Upcoming potential regulatory changes and the further development of the Swiss economy after the discontinuation of the Euro minimum exchange rate might potentially have a medium-term impact on Cembra Money Bank’s business. At the current stage it is difficult to quantify the medium-term impacts. However, short-term Cembra Money Bank remains confident and hence is expecting reported earnings per share (EPS) of between CHF 4.50 and CHF 4.70 for 2015.<sup>9</sup></span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>All documents (results presentation and this media release) will be available from 07:00 a.m. CET at www.cembra.ch/en/investor.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border: currentColor;

				<div class="body">
	<p><span>Zurich, Switzerland – Cembra Money Bank, a leading Swiss consumer finance bank, reports consolidated net income for the financial year 2013 of CHF 132.9 million on a US GAAP basis or CHF 4.43 per share</span><sup><span>1</span></sup><span>. This translates into a return on average equity<sup>2</sup> of 14.1% or 16.6% based on year-end equity. Costs remained well under control with a cost/income ratio<sup>3</sup> of 50% and 44% when excluding IPO-related one-time costs. While net financing receivables remained stable, the funding was changed to become more diversified post IPO. Based on its strong capital position with a Tier 1 capital ratio<sup>4</sup> of 19.7%, Cembra Money Bank’s Board of Directors proposes a dividend per share of CHF 2.85 to be paid out of capital contributions reserves<sup>5</sup>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Robert Oudmayer</span></strong><span>, Chief Executive Officer, said: “2013 was an exciting year for our Bank with the successful IPO in October and the rebranding to Cembra Money Bank. We executed on these milestones extremely well. At the same time we didn’t lose focus on our daily business as our financial results can demonstrate. We are well positioned in our transition to being a stand-alone company.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Operating performance</span></strong></p><p><span>Net revenues were stable at CHF 354.5 million compared to CHF 355.7 million in 2012. Net interest income, which accounts for 80% of net revenues, was virtually unchanged at CHF 282.6 million, reflecting a stable net interest margin<sup>6</sup> of 7.0%. Lower interest income was compensated by cheaper funding. Commission and fee income, which contributes 20% to net revenues, was down 2% to CHF 71.9 million. Provisions for losses fell to CHF 7.0 million supported by a positive CHF 21.1 million net impact from the sale of a portfolio of loss certificates (CHF 33.1 million partially offset by an estimated CHF 12.0 million recovery impact) in the first half of 2013. Operating expenses were up 9% driven by significant IPO-related one-off costs. These costs amount to CHF 23.3 million and include the rebranding campaign to Cembra Money Bank, transaction-related costs and share issuance costs. The cost/income ratio was 50% including one-off costs and 44% on an adjusted basis.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank’s prudent risk management approach was reflected in the loss rate<sup>7</sup> of 0.2% of financing receivables including the gain on loss certificates and delinquencies at low levels: 1.8% for 30+ days past due<sup>8</sup> and 0.4% for non-performing loans<sup>9</sup>.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Balance sheet and capital developments</span></strong></p><p><span>Total assets grew by 3% to CHF 4,590 million, mainly as a result of higher cash holdings at year-end. Net financing receivables (representing loans and leases to customers) were barely unchanged at CHF 3,993 million. Continued strong growth in Credit Cards (up 19% versus 2012) was offset by lower receivables in Personal Loans driven by the continued run-off of a product and challenging market conditions in Auto. The funding of the balance sheet changed significantly in 2013. Funding from former parent GE Capital was more than halved to CHF 700 million. Cembra Money Bank tapped capital markets successfully, issuing a second Auto ABS of CHF 200 million in the first half of the year and its first senior unsecured bond for CHF 250 million in the second half of the year. Both issues were very well received by the market and could be executed at attractive terms, reflecting the confidence the market has into Cembra Money Bank as a stand-alone company</span><span>. Furthermore, institutional deposits grew by 53% to CHF 1,165 million. Additionally, Cembra Money Bank was granted a CHF 450 million loan by a syndicate of international banks. Shareholder’s equity fell from CHF 1,081 million to CHF 799 million as a result of CHF 470 million dividend payments prior to the IPO, partially offset by 2013 net income. The consolidated Tier 1 capital ratio stands at high 19.7%, including the proposed dividend pay-out.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Dividend proposal</span></strong></p><p><span>Based on its strong capital position Cembra Money Bank’s Board of Directors will propose to the annual general meeting on 13 May 2014 that a dividend per share of CHF 2.85 be paid out of reserves from capital contributions. The distribution will therefore not be subject to Swiss withholding tax for Swiss individual investors who hold their shares as private assets. The dividend reflects a pay-out ratio of 64% of consolidated net income.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Antoine Boublil</span></strong><span>, Chief Financial Officer, commented: “We have made good progress in 2013 on our funding plans as an independent company and we are also ahead of our capital ratio guidance.”</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Product lines</span></strong></p><p><span>Net financing receivables in Personal Loans stood at CHF 1.9 billion (decrease of 2% versus 2012) by end 2013 while interest income was down 3% to CHF 218.5 million in 2013.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Credit Cards again recorded double digit growth with net financing receivables increasing by 19% to CHF 0.5 billion. Interest income of CHF 32.3 million was 26% higher than in the previous year. The number of issued cards grew by 17% to 553’000 with the Cumulus MasterCard being the main driver. The contracts with Migros and Conforama were successfully extended.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>In a very competitive environment Auto defended its market position. Net financing receivables declined 3% or CHF 56 million to CHF 1.6 billion. Interest income slipped 9% to CHF 92.9 million as a result of lower rates offered in the market.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Outlook</span></strong></p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank is currently expecting interest rates to stay at historically low levels and therefore pricing competition to remain fierce in particular in Auto. Credit Cards is expected to continue on its growth path. Medium-term targets remain unchanged including a dividend pay-out ratio of 60-70% of net income. Considering the current market conditions Cembra Money Bank is expecting earnings per share of between CHF 4.40 and CHF 4.60 for 2014.</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>All documents (results presentation, letter to shareholders and this media release) will be available from 07:00 a.m. CET at www.cembra.ch/en/investor</span></p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Contacts</span></strong></p><p><span>Media:</span></p><p><span>Brigitte Kaps; +41 44 439 8194;</span> <a href="mailto:brigitte.kaps@cembra.ch">brigitte.kaps@cembra.ch</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p><span>Investor Relations:</span></p><p><span>Christian Waelti; +41 44 439 8572;</span> <a href="mailto:christian.waelti@cembra.ch">christian.waelti@cembra.ch</a></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>Key dates</span></strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="138"><p><span>28 March 2014</span></p></td><td valign="top" width="359"><p><span>Publication of Annual Report 2013</span></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="138"><p><span>13 May 2014</span></p></td><td valign="top" width="359"><p><span>Annual General Meeting 2014</span></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="138"><p><span>15 May 2014</span></p></td><td valign="top" width="359"><p><span>Ex-dividend date</span></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="138"><p><span>19 May 2014</span></p></td><td valign="top" width="359"><p><span>Record date</span></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="138"><p><span>20 May 2014</span></p></td><td valign="top" width="359"><p><span>Dividend payment date</span></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="138"><p><span>29 August 2014</span></p></td><td valign="top" width="359"><p><span>First-half 2014 results</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><span>About Cembra Money Bank AG</span></strong></p><p><span>Cembra Money Bank is a Bank with a well-established position in Swiss consumer finance.

	<p align="justify">There will be an initial public offering in Switzerland to retail and institutional investors, private placements to institutional investors in certain jurisdictions outside Switzerland and the US in accordance with applicable securities laws and in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act and on the basis of exemptions provided by directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 4 November 2003 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading, as amended and within the US to qualified institutional buyers as defined in, and in reliance upon, the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act (the “Offering”).</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">The price for each Share in the proposed Offering is expected to be between CHF 43 to CHF 51, which would imply a total market capitalisation of CHF 1,290 million to CHF 1,530 million.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">The selling shareholder, GE Capital Swiss Funding AG, (the “Selling Shareholder”) will offer up to 18,000,000 Shares, representing up to 60% of the Company’s Shares, with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each (the “Base Offer”).</p><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify">In addition, the Selling Shareholder has granted the syndicate banks an over-allotment option of up to 2,500,000 Shares, representing approximately 13.9% of the Shares offered in the Base Offer, which can be exercised within 30 days after the first trading day on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The free float is expected to amount to approximately 60% of the Shares before exercise of the overallotment option (assuming all 18,000,000 Shares are sold) and approximately 68.3% if the overallotment option is exercised in full, corresponding to a total placement volume of up to CHF 882 to CHF 1,046 million assuming full exercise of the over-allotment option. The Selling Shareholder and the Company have committed to a lock-up period of 12 months and 6 months respectively after the listing (subject to customary exceptions).</p><p align="left">&#160;</p><p align="justify">The book-building process begins on 16 October 2013 and is expected to end on or around 29 October 2013, noon CET.

We look forward to our future as an independent bank with confidence.”</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">GE Capital will continue to maintain a strong relationship with the Company after the proposed IPO to ensure its smooth transition to an independent company. Although its residual stake in the Company will reduce over time, GE Capital is committed to retaining a significant minority stake for a period of one year under the terms of its lock-up arrangements. It will also continue to be an important source of funding for the Company, providing committed funding of up to CHF 1 billion for five years. GE Capital will initially have two directors on the Board of Directors of the Company.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Important information for media:</strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Listing</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>SIX Swiss Exchange (Main Standard)</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Ticker symbol</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>CMBN</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>ISIN</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>CH022 517 316 7</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Price range</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>CHF 43 to CHF 51 per Share</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p align="left">Offered shares by Selling Shareholder</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Base Offer of up to 18,000,000 Shares</p><p>Over-allotment option of up to 2,500,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Anticipated schedule</strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Book-building period</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p align="left">16 October 2013 to on or around 29 October 2013 noon CET</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Pricing and allocation</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Expected to occur on or around 29 October 2013</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p align="left">Announcement of final offer price per Share and final number of offered Shares</p><p align="left">Listing and first day of trading</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>On or around 30 October 2013</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p align="left">Book-entry delivery of offered Shares against payment of the offer price</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>On or around&#160;4 November 2013</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Further information about GE Money Bank AG</strong></p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">The Company is a bank with a well-established position in Swiss consumer finance.

				<div class="body">
	<p>The IPO was many times over-subscribed due to strong demand from international and Swiss institutional investors as well as private Swiss investors. It priced at CHF 51 per share, the top of the price range of CHF 43 to CHF 51 per share, implying a total market capitalisation for Cembra Money Bank of CHF 1,530 million. The Shares (ticker symbol: CMBN) will commence trading today on the SIX Swiss Exchange.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Robert Oudmayer, CEO of Cembra Money Bank AG</strong>, said: “We are proud of the successful placement of our shares and the strong investor interest in our Company.

The free float will amount to 60% of the Shares before exercise of the over-allotment option and approximately 68.3% if the overallotment option is exercised in full, corresponding to a total placement volume of CHF 1,046 million assuming full exercise of the over-allotment option. The Selling Shareholder and the Company have committed to a lock-up period of 12 months and 6 months respectively after the listing (subject to customary exceptions).</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Important information for media:</strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Listing</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>SIX Swiss Exchange (Main Standard)</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Ticker symbol</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>CMBN</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Swiss security number</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>22 517 316</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>ISIN</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>CH 022 517316 7</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Offer price</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>CHF 51 per Share</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Offered shares by Selling Shareholder</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Base Offer of 18,000,000 Shares</p><p>Over-allotment option of up to 2,500,000 Shares</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Anticipated schedule</strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Listing and first day of trading</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Wednesday, 30 October 2013</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Book-entry delivery of offered Shares against payment of the offer price</p></td><td valign="top" width="300"><p>Monday, 4 November 2013</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Further information about Cembra Money Bank AG</strong></p><p align="justify">The Company is a bank with a well-established position in Swiss consumer finance.

				<div class="body">
	<p><strong>Robert Oudmayer</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, said: “We are very satisfied with the operating results of the first half 2014 under our new brand Cembra Money Bank. We have been able to gain market share in all three business lines and our business transition as stand-alone company is well on track.”</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Operating performance</strong></p><p align="justify">Compared to first-half 2013, net revenues increased by 8% to CHF 185.9 million, driven by both net interest income as well as commission and fee income. Net interest income, which accounts for 80% of net revenues, was 7% higher at CHF 148.4 million, reflecting a net interest margin<sup>5</sup> of 7.2%. Main driver of the increase in net interest income was lower funding costs due to changes in the funding mix. Commissions and fee income, which contribute 20% to net revenues, were 9% higher at CHF 37.5 million. Provisions for losses came in at CHF 21.0 million translating into a loss rate<sup>6</sup> of 1.0% of financing receivables; in-line with the guidance provided earlier. First-half 2013 provisions had been positively impacted by the sale of a portfolio of loss certificates for CHF 33.1 million. Total operating expenses were 4% higher at CHF 82.6 million mainly driven by a CHF 3.0 million one-off provision related to the FINMA investigation. While personnel expenses decreased by 7% to CHF 47.9 million because of lower pension costs and increased headcount productivity, operational general and administrative expenses increased to CHF 31.7 million mainly due to the on-going business separation from GE. This resulted in a cost/income ratio of 44.5%, or 42.8% adjusted for the FINMA-related provision. Income before taxes amounted to CHF 82.3 million while the tax rate remained unchanged at approx. 21%. This led to a net income of CHF 64.7 million representing an increase of 5% compared to first-half 2013 net income adjusted for the one-off gain from the sale of loss certificates.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Cembra Money Bank’s prudent risk management approach was reflected in stable delinquencies at low levels: 2.0% for 30+ days past due<sup>7</sup> and 0.5% for non-performing loans<sup>8</sup>.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Balance sheet and capital developments</strong></p><p align="justify">Net financing receivables (representing loans and leases to customers) increased by 3% or CHF 119 million to CHF 4,112 million. All three business lines reported growth versus year-end 2013 gaining market share in their respective markets. Funding from former parent GE Capital was reduced further to CHF 500 million translating into a stand-alone funding of 87%. Institutional and retail deposits grew by 14% to CHF 1,898 million, reflecting investor’s confidence into Cembra Money Bank as a stand-alone company. Additionally, Cembra Money Bank successfully converted its historical CHF 200 million facility with a syndicate of local Swiss banks into a CHF 150 million 3-year term loan and a CHF 100 million revolving facility. Shareholders’ equity slightly declined to CHF 780 million as a result of the CHF 85.5 million dividend payment in May, partially offset by first-half 2014 net income. With risk-weighted assets of CHF 3,697 million (up 3% versus year-end 2013) and eligible Tier 1 capital of CHF 732 million, the Tier 1 capital ratio reached a high 19.8% by end-June 2014.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Antoine Boublil</strong>, Chief Financial Officer, commented: “We made good progress on our funding, reaching 87% on a standalone basis driven by deposits which now account for more than 50% of the funding base. We also have CHF 67 million of excess capital as of June 2014.”</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Product lines</strong></p><p align="justify">In a slightly decreasing market, Personal Loans was able to consolidate its strong market position with receivables increasing by 1% versus year-end 2013 to CHF 1,888 million. Interest income was 3% lower at CHF 106.0 million compared to first-half 2013.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">While new car registrations in Switzerland declined by 4% in the first half 2014, product line Auto was able to capitalize on the rebranding and increased net financing receivables by 2% to CHF 1,688 million.

Given the seasonality in Cembra Money Bank’s business, net profit for the second half-year 2014 is expected to exceed first-half net profit. Medium-term targets remain unchanged including a dividend pay-out ratio of 60-70% of net income, a minimum Tier-1 ratio of 18%, return on equity (ROE) of at least 15% and financing receivables to grow in line with Swiss GDP.</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">All documents (half-year report, results presentation, letter to shareholders and this media release) will be available from 07:00 a.m. CET at www.cembra.ch/en/investor</p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Contacts</strong></p><p align="justify">Media:</p><p align="justify">Brigitte Kaps; +41 44 439 8194; <a href="mailto:brigitte.kaps@cembra.ch">brigitte.kaps@cembra.ch</a></p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify">Investor Relations:</p><p align="justify">Christian Waelti; +41 44 439 8572; <a href="mailto:christian.waelti@cembra.ch">christian.waelti@cembra.ch</a></p><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>Key dates</strong></p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="140"><p>26 February 2015</p></td><td valign="top" width="461"><p>Publication of full-year 2014 results</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="140"><p>29 April 2015</p></td><td valign="top" width="461"><p>Annual General Meeting 2015</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p align="justify">&#160;</p><p align="justify"><strong>About Cembra Money Bank AG</strong></p><p align="justify">Cembra Money Bank is a Bank with a well-established position in Swiss consumer finance.
